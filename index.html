        <p>For those interested in a career in development, there are many aspects to consider. Firstly, you need a passion for writing code. The web moves fast, and it will be a big part of your job to move with it. You’ll have to learn new languages and get your hands on new tools as time goes by.</p>

        <p>HTML isn’t a programming language, neither CSS, but markup tools used to design web pages and user interfaces. HTML is a hypertext markup language that structures the content and layout of the web page, and CSS controls its display. It’s the very backbone of every website, therefore it is a must to learn for anyone aspiring to work in the front-end development field.</p>
